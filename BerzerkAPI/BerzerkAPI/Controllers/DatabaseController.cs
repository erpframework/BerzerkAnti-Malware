     * Description: 
     *              The database controller template is a base class for most of the controllers that 
     *              the database controllers (such as signature and cached files) wil use. It contains
     *              a few methods in which all controllers will require as well as a file path
     *              to save and load the database from. All database at this time will be stored 
     *              locally.
