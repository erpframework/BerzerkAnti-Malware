# BerzerkAnti-Malware

BerzerkAnti-Malware is a simple C# application I am working on for fun and to learn more about security and malware in general. The BerzerkAnti-Malware Toolkit is going to contain a few tools in which will help developers and analysts detect, catalogue and find new threats. 

Currently BerzerkAnti-Malware is being designed as a simple byte[] pattern scanning engine however I plan to implement more advanced scanning techniques later. 

If you are interested in collaborating in this project or wish to contribute to the threat detect database please feel free to contact me.
